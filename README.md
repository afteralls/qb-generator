## Available formats
- EAN 13: The European Article Number is a standard to encode product numbers. The EAN is a special case of a Global Trade Item Number.
- EAN 8: The same as the format above, but was introduced for use on small packages where the EAN-13 barcode would be too large.
- CODE 128 is a high-density linear barcode symbology defined in ISO/IEC. It's used for alphanumeric or numeric-only barcodes.
- ITF-14 is the GS1 implementation of an Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF) bar code to encode a Global Trade Item Number. ITF-14 symbols are generally used on packaging levels of a product, such as a case box of 24 cans of soup. The ITF-14 will always encode 14 digits.
- MSI ‚Äî The code can display only the number 0-9 and has no fixed length. Today this type of code is outdated and is no longer used. Because of this most barcode scanners can not recognize this type of code.
- Pharmacode: Pharmaceutical Binary Code is a barcode standard, used in the pharmaceutical industry as a packing control system. It is designed to be readable despite printing errors.

## Export options
1. PNG is a raster-graphics file format that supports lossless data compression.
2. JPG is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality.
3. SVG is an XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, having support for interactivity and animation.
